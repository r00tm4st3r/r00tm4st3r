# Background üè¥
Just a curious guy who is passionate about software development, low-level programming languages, and exploit development. I‚Äôm fascinated by how software really works, from the way code interacts with hardware to how complex systems are built and maintained.

I enjoy digging into the internals of software, understanding performance, structure, and design. My curiosity drives me to explore areas such as front-end and back-end development, as well as how vulnerabilities work from discovery to exploitation.

While I‚Äôm not specialized yet, I believe that to become a strong developer, you need to understand both how to build software and how it can break. That mindset keeps me learning, experimenting, and pushing my skills forward every day.
